Money Management Program

This is a Java program designed to help users manage their finances by calculating net income after tax, monthly expenses, and loan repayments (both property and vehicle). It provides warnings if expenses exceed a certain threshold of the user's income.

Features

Calculate net income after taxes.

Income Calculation: Users can input their gross monthly income and tax rate to calculate their net monthly income.

Expense Tracking: The program records various monthly expenses such as groceries, utilities, travel, phone, and other expenditures.

Accommodation Calculation: The user can choose between buying property or renting accommodation, and the program calculates home loan payments or rent amounts.

Vehicle Loan Calculation: Option to calculate vehicle loan payments based on the purchase price, deposit, interest rate, and loan term.

Warnings: The program issues warnings if total expenses exceed 75% of the userâ€™s income or if home loan payments exceed one-third of gross monthly income.

How to Use

Run the program in a Java environment.

Enter your gross monthly income and tax rate.

Provide the amounts for your monthly expenses such as groceries, utilities, travel, phone, and other costs.

Choose whether you are buying a property or renting accommodation:

If buying, input the property price, deposit, interest rate, and loan term.

Optionally, if you are financing a vehicle, provide the vehicle purchase price, deposit, interest rate, and loan term.

The program will display your net monthly income, total monthly expenses, and remaining income.

Warnings

If your total expenses exceed 75% of your income, the program will issue a warning.
